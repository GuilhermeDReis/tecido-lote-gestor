# Component Relationships

## Introduction
Component relationships within the tecido-lote-gestor project refer to how different components interact and communicate with each other, including data flow, architecture diagrams, and key functions or classes that play a crucial role in the system. Understanding these relationships is essential for maintaining the project's structure, performance, and reliability.

## Detailed Sections

### 1. **Data Flow Diagrams**
- **`tecido-lote-gestor/src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`** contains detailed types definitions for database entries such as `cliente`, which indicates how data flows between components related to client information.
  
### 2. **Architectural Relationships**
#### **1.1 Component A (e.g., `tecido-lote-gestor/src/pages/ConsultaClientes.tsx`) with Component B (e.g., `tecido-lote-gestor/src/components/ui/alert.tsx`)**

- **`tecido-lote-gestor/src/pages/ConsultaClientes.tsx`**:
  - Uses the `alert` component from `tecido-lote-gestor/src/components/ui/alert.tsx`.
  
### 3. **Key Functions and Classes**
#### **1.1 Function A (e.g., `tecido-lote-gestor/src/hooks/useClientes.ts`) with Class B (e.g., `tecido-lote-gestor/src/pages/CadastroClientes.tsx`)**

- **Function A**:
  - Retrieves clients from the database using a supabase query.
  
- **Class B**:
  - The component for managing client-related actions, including adding and updating clients.

### 4. **Sequence Diagrams**
#### **1.2 Sequence Diagram for Component C (e.g., `tecido-lote-gestor/src/pages/ConsultaLote.tsx`)**

```
sequenceDiagram
- Client requests a lote.
- Lote is found in database.
- Database updates the client's last login time with current timestamp.
```


### 5. **Configuration Options**
#### **1.3 Configuration for Component D (e.g., `tecido-lote-gestor/src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`)**

- Defines how to query and update database entries, including parameters like `codigo`, `id`, and `created_at`.
  
### 6. **Data Model Fields**
#### **1.4 Data Model for Component E (e.g., `tecido-lote-gestor/src/pages/CadastroLote.tsx`)**

- Table fields such as `nome`, `observacao`, `updated_at`, etc.
